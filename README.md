# Norwich Analytics Tool

## Overview

Norwich Analytics Tool is a small research and analytics project designed to collect and analyse publicly available online discussions relating to Norwich and the surrounding area.

The tool will use the official Reddit API to gather open posts and comments from relevant public subreddits and transform them into useful, high-level insights.

## Purpose

The aim of the project is to better understand local conversations and trends by:

* Collecting public Reddit posts and comments related to Norwich
* Identifying common topics and recurring themes
* Tracking what local issues or interests are discussed most often
* Monitoring how discussions change over time
* Producing simple aggregated reports and summaries

The project is focused entirely on analysing publicly available information and turning it into structured, meaningful insights.

## What the Tool Will Do

* Connect to the Reddit API in a read-only capacity
* Retrieve posts and comments from selected public subreddits
* Store this data for analysis
* Process text to extract trends and topics
* Generate aggregated analytics and reports

## What the Tool Will Not Do

This application will never:

* Post, comment, or interact with Reddit users
* Message users or collect private data
* Vote or manipulate Reddit content
* Profile or identify individual Redditors

All analysis is performed on aggregated, anonymised, publicly visible data only.

## Technology

The project will be built using:

* Reddit API with OAuth authentication
* Python or JavaScript for data collection
* Local database storage
* Basic text analysis and reporting tools

## Compliance

All usage will follow Reddit API Terms of Use and rate limits.

No personal data will be targeted or distributed, and all processing will respect Reddit’s platform policies.

## Current Status

This repository is currently in early development and will contain the code that accesses the Reddit API once access is approved.
